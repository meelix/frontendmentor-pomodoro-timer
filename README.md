## Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Css grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## Process

Had a lot of issues geting the script working properly (was a stupid idea to do it without any library). It was also very difficult handeling localStorage with user interactions, reloads, first visit, reset... Other then that the circular progress bar was pretty difficult too until I found [this codepen](https://codepen.io/ahmedhrayyan/pen/GLBELM) which solved all of the issues I had.

Stylewise it's complex but not too difficult.
